<h2>Motivation</h2>
Machine learning without plots is like food without salt
You can use matplotlib , seaborn and other but here i put plots that i need but could not find elsewhere so i do it my self

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>plot_with_residual</td>
    <td>
    <ul>
    <li>function to plot X,Y vs linear line + residuals </li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
